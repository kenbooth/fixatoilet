If you wish to further disinfect your plunger, put a quarter cup of bleach in the bowl and move the plunger around in the water. If you have a septic system be sure to use a non-chlorine bleach. When you’re finished, flush the toilet and rinse the plunger in the clean bowl water.

You can also spray the plunger with a disinfectant, such as Lysol.
