If you're looking for the **best toilet plunger**, we've got you covered with our toilet plunger reviews. We've done our research and looked at the best selling and highest rates toilet plungers to uncover the truth. We have toilet plunger reviews and top picks for low-flow toilets, traditional toilets and discrete looks.

Most toilet clogs happen in the toilet itself, in the trap. The trap is u-shaped section inside the toilet that holds water and keeps sewer gases from escaping into the home. Because of the tight turns of the trap, blockages usually occur at this point. A plunger works by forcing the blockage through the trap and into the larger diameter sewer pipe that lies beyond the toilet.

It's important that your plunger make a tight seal with the bottom of your toilet. With a tight seal all of the force is directed down the toilet toward the blockage.

### Best Toilet Plunger for Low-Flow Toilets

##### Korky 99-4A Max Performance Plunger

\[caption id="attachment\_219" align="alignright" width="80"\]![Korky 99-4A best toilet plunger](images/99-4A-Plunger-80x300.jpg) Korky 99-4A.\[/caption\]

The Korky 99-4A works especially well with low-flow toilets and is our choice for **best toilet plunger** overall. The lower section is made of a soft rubber and forms to the shape of most any toilet, which is especially useful with the oblong shape of many low-flow toilets. But the Korky 99-4A works well with traditional toilets as well.

With a beehive shape, the Korky 99-4A can create a great deal of pressure. While the lower portion is made of soft rubber, the middle section is made of a stiffer material that helps generate that additional pressure.

The unique t-shaped handle also makes this one of the easiest plungers to use. It is less awkward to handle and the handle makes it even easier to work the plunger, generating the force necessary to clear a blockage.

This Old House rated the Korky 99-4A as one of its Best New Home Products when it was released. The Korky 99-4A has 4.5 stars on Amazon and Home Depot websites,  generating hundreds of positive reviews.

##### G.T. Water Products, Inc. MP100-3 Master Plunger

\[caption id="attachment\_237" align="alignright" width="95"\]![Master Plunger review](images/master-plunger-95x300.jpg) MP100-3 Master Plunger.\[/caption\]

The Master Plunger moves a lot of water and with its oversized baffle design it can create a lot of force. The large baffles do tend to trap water and debris, however, so this plunger should be cleaned after use.

The Master Plunger has to be seated properly in the toilet and will work best with traditional toilets with round openings. Made of a stiffer material, it will not adjust to form most low-flow toilets. Like the other plungers tested here, the Master Plunger has earned 4.5 stars at Amazon.

### Proper plunger technique

To make clearing your clogged toilet easier, follow these basic steps:

1. Place the plunger in the toilet and fill the cup with water. You can start with a gentle plunge to expel the air from the cup. You want to use water to free your clog, not trapped air. The water volume will help you generate greater clearing power.
2. Make sure the plunger has a good seal with the toilet opening. You may  need to adjust the angle away from vertical to get the best seal on some low-flow toilets.
3. Start with some gentle pumps of the plunger. It's important to work water, and thus the clog, back and forth to dislodge it. You can slowly increase the force as necessary to dislodge the clog.

### Cleaning a plunger

After you've used your plunger you can rinse it in the clean water that remains in the bowl. You can also submerge the plunger in the bowl and give the toilet a flush, to help cleanse the plunger.

If you wish to further disinfect your plunger, put a quarter cup of bleach in the bowl and move the plunger cup around in the water. Be sure to use a non-chlorine bleach if you have a septic system. When you're done, flush the toilet and rinse the plunger in the clean water of the bowl.

You can also opt to spray the plunger with a disinfectant, such as Lysol.

### What won't work

A standard sink plunger, with a flat base and no type of flange is made to be placed against flat surfaces like a shower or sink drain. These types of plungers will not make a good seal in a toilet or generate enough force to dislodge a clog.
