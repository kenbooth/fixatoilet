Nobody enjoys fighting with a problem toilet, especially when its a clogged one. There are a number of ways to effectively clear your toilets drain and I have mentioned one of those below:

**Good Old Soapy Water** - You may not believe it at first, but one of the best drain cleaners that you can own, is right over by your kitchen sink. Dish detergent.

A good amount of liquid soap, mixed with a small bucket of water can work extremely well with even the toughest [clogged toilet](http://fixatoilet.com "clogged toilet"). Simply pour the mixture into the toilet bowl and allow to sit for about fifteen minutes. After your short wait, simply plunge and flush.

Your clog should be gone for good! Or, at least until the next one.
