The new $29 [CitiKitty](http://www.citikitty.com/) toilet training system for cats promises to have your feline potty trained in weeks. The CitiKitty is a training seat that replaces the litter box and sits on the toilet. After a cat begins using the new seat with kitty litter, internal ringer are slowly removed to finally expose an open toilet.
