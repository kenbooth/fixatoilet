Toilet maker Toto has [recalled](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070416/ap_on_fe_st/toilets_on_fire;_ylt=Ar4T0mQRl09twigc9A3TyPXMWM0F) 180,000 of its Z-series toilets "after wiring problems caused three to catch fire over the past year." This is probably not a risk people want to assume when using a toilet. Toto will repair the toilets for free. Simply contact the [manufacturer](http://www.totousa.com/contactus.asp) for more information.
