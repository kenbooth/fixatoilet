Inax has come out with a [new toilet](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/satisfying_design_6107.asp) that features an SD memory card slot for playing your favorite tunes through built-in-stereo speakers. The card comes pre-loaded with some classical songs from Bach, Chopin and Mendelsohn. The Satis Asteo Washlet also has a sensor that automatically raises and lowers the seat and features an in-bowl light for night trips to the toilet.
