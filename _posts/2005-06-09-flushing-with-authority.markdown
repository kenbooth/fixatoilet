American Standard is after the Holy Grail of home plumbing: The plunger-less toilet. And they believe they’ve found it with the [Champion](http://www.americanstandard-us.com/planDesign/performance/BestFlush/best_flush.asp), which can flush 24 golf balls at a time. The New York Times [profiles the business](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/business/19place.html) and its efforts to improve the flushing capacity of its products.

> The Champion resulted from research showing that customers would buy a toilet that they never had to use a plunger on. That the company even did such research, Mr. Poses maintained, showed that it is finally out of its traditional “if we build it, they will buy it” mentality. “For us,” he said, “the Champion is a milestone.”
