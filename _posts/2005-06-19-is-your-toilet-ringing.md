If you drop your cell phone in the toilet and think you can get away with getting it replaced under warranty, think again. The phone companies are on to you. They're using a [special label](http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/2673). with a dot that turns red if it comes in contact with water. One glance and they know it wasn't a random malfunction.
