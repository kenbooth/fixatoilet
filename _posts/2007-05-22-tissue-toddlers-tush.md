The new [Cottonelle Kids](http://www.kimberly-clark.com/news/cottonelleforkids_newsrelease.asp) line of toilet tissues is targeted at parents of 4-to-9 year olds. In addition to child-friendly graphics, the new tissue aims to solve a parenting concern that children use too much tissue. Printed on each roll are graphics that instruct kids where to tear. The line also includes flushable moist wipes that limit children to one wipe at a time.
