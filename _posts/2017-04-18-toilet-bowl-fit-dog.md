A **toilet bowl dog dish** should put a smile on any mutt's face. These funny, novelty dog bowls can both be filled with a 2-liter bottle inverted into the back of the toilet tank.

Both of these toilet bowl dog dishes are gravity fed and will refill the bowl as needed, keeping your puppy pleased with an ample supply of water. Just make sure your pet can distinguish between this and the real thing.

_Tip: Make sure the water bottle is fully inserted inside the tank and makes a good seal. The dog toilet bowl dog dish is gravity fed and needs a tight fit to work correctly._

_Tip 2: Some people report that over time the toilet bowl dog dish may leak between the toilet tank and the toilet bowl. You can use a clear, waterproof silicone sealant where the edge of the tank meets the side of the bowl. The additional sealant should solve any leaks that might spring up._
