From the celebrity toilet file we find that the bathroom is a popular location for celebrities to display their **Oscar statuettes**. **Susan Sarandon** is probably most famous for keeping her Oscar in the bathroom. She has even Tweeted confirmation and a photo of her Oscar for _Dead Man Walking_ on [display in her bathroom](https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/848720799007690752).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hedda’s wrong. Bette’s Oscars weren’t in the bathroom, but mine is. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FeudFX?src=hash">#FeudFX</a> <a href="https://t.co/unuH4j0olD">pic.twitter.com/unuH4j0olD</a></p>— Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/848720799007690752">April 3, 2017</a></blockquote>

But Sarandon is not alone and anyone heading into**Kate Winslet's** bathroom to do a [toilet repair](https://fixatoilet.com) may run across some Hollywood bling. [The Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/winslet-oscar-bathroom-guests-give-speeches-article-1.2380250) reports that Winslet keeps her Oscar statuette on display in a bathroom where guests can take advantage of the mirror to give their own acceptance speeches. She says:

> "The whole point is for everybody to pick it up and go, 'I'd like to thank my son and my dad,' ... and you can always tell when someone has, because they're in there a little bit longer after they flushed. They'll come out looking slightly pink-cheeked. It's hysterical."

**Emma Thompson** is also known for keeping her Oscar, for Best Actress in _Howard's End_, in the bathroom.  “They look far too outré anywhere else," she [has said](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stars-stash-oscars-160123). "They're great big, gold, shiny things. They're up there tarnishing quietly along with everything else I own, including my body.”

**Jodie Foster** used to keep her Oscar in the bathroom, but has since moved them to a more traditional trophy case. "They looked good with the faucets,” [said Foster](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/25/where-oscar-winners-keep-their-awards).
