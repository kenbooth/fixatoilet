The [Big John Toilet Seat](http://www.bigjohntoiletseat.com/) offers super-size comfort for those who could use the extra room that comes from a **large toilet seat**. Any plus-size consumers who find standard toilet seats too low and too unsupportive for their needs should consider upgrading to an oversized toilet seat.

### How to install a large toilet seat

The large toilet seat is easy to install.  The only tools that are needed are a wrench and pliers.

First, locate where the bolts on the existing seat go through the toilet bowl. There may be have a plastic cap you will need to flip open to expose the bolt. Next, with a pair of adjustable pliers loosen the bolt at the bottom of the bowl housing.

Now, put your new large toilet seat on the top of the bowl and feed the bolts through the holes. Place the nuts on the bottom of the bolts and tighten using an adjustable wrench. Be sure not to over tighten the bolts as this could crack the bowl. You can learn more in our instructions for [toilet seat replacement](http://fixatoilet.com/loose-toilet-seat/).
