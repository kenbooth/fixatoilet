Former pit mechanic Paul Stender rolled up his sleeves and turned out a [jet-powered port-a-potty](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/1ae60e0796b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html). It can't actually be used as a toilet, but it will get you down the highway pretty quickly.

> Powered by a 50-year-old, 750-pound Boeing jet turbine that Stender bought for $5,000, the “Port-O-Jet” can top 46 mph with a tailwind. “It’s not real aerodynamic,” he allows.

The driver sits on the original seat and looks through a hole in the door.
