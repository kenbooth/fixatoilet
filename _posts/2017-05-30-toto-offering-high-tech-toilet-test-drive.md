If you are in San Francisco and want to test drive a high-tech toilet, head down to Toto's [Concept 190](http://concept190.totousa.com/index) near AT&T Park.  Toto has opened a showroom featuring their Washlet, which includes a bidet with a heated seat, a lid that opens automatically, a bidet with "customizable spray patterns and pressures," a dryer and a deodorizer. And when you are finished,  it even self cleans the toilet bowl.

Toto is one of the biggest [toilet manufacturers](http://fixatoilet.com/toilet-manufacturers/) in Japan, specializing in high-end toilets that can cost as much as $10,000. The Washlets start at $499 and run up to $3,300.

If you've ever wanted to take a try a Toto, head on over to 190 King Street.
