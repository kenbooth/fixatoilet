NASA has signed a $46 million contract with Russia's S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Public Corporation, for a [new toilet](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_C07028_station_hardware.html) on the International Space Station.

The toilet system is similar to one in use in the station's Zvezda Service Module and will be used for the planned expansion from three to six crew members in 2009. The system will be able to automatically transfer urine to a U.S. device that can generate potable water.
