The March issue of Wired Magazine (not yet available online) takes a look at the latest toilet tech. American Standard is employing aerospace engineers to get their low-flush models working smoothly and Toto's new [Neorest 600](http://www.totousa.com/toto/productpage.asp?PID=692), which features a wireless remote, is a hit among celebrities.

> According to Toto, A-list royalty sits upon this throne: Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Charlie Sheen, Will Smith. 'They're toilet paper-free,' Smith gushed to Access Hollywood. 'You sit on the toilet and there's a spray that's so deadly accurate - wherever you sit on the toilet, somehow it always hits the bull's-eye perfectly.'

But the Neorest, with its 16-bit processor, 512 Kbytes of RAM and $5,000 price tag likely won't appeal to most American consumers.

Update: The article is now available [online](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.03/toilet.html).
