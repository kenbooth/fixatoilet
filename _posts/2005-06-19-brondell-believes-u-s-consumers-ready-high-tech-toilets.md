Brondell believes United States consumers will have an appetite for high-tech toilets. The San Francisco Chronicle [interviews](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/02/07/BUGN9B65931.DTL&type=business) the co-founders of Brondell, a San Francisco firm that this past week began selling its [Swash](http://www.brondell.com/Swash-600-400.php4) toilets, which I noted in an earlier post. The co-founders bring technology credentials to the business. David Samuel started Spinner.com and Scott Pinizzotto is a former Sony Corp. engineer.

Samuel, who sold the Web music service Spinner Networks Inc. to America Online for $320 million in 1999 , said he believes that the Swash, like TiVo, the digital video recording device, must be used to be fully appreciated. ''Once someone experiences one of our warm toilet seats and the warm-water bidet, there's no going back to the cold porcelain toilet,'' he said.
