If you've heard some people tell you it's OK to flush tampons while others warn against the practice you may be confused about conflicting instructions and wondering, "**Can I flush tampons down the toilet?**" Despite what some  may tell you, you should **never** flush tampons down the toilet.

Tampons do not break down in water and because they are made specifically to absorb liquids, expand and stay in place, they can easily become lodged in a toilet creating a hard to clear clog. In the worst case a tampon may clog pipes further down the line from the toilet, creating a very difficult to clear obstruction.

### Can I flush tampons down the toilet?

Now that we know the answer to this question is, "no," you may wonder what is the proper method for disposing of a tampon.

The only real solution is to dispose of the tampon in the trash. And proper etiquette would dictate that you wrap the tampon in toilet paper or place it in a hygiene disposal box if it's available. If the original wrapper is still available, that is another popular option before placing the used tampon in the trash.

[Kotex](https://www.ubykotex.com.au/femcare-products/tampons/inserting) advises:

> Don’t flush tampons and wrappers down the toilet – you might clog up the plumbing system and it’s bad for the environment. Just wrap it in some toilet paper (or put it in a bag) and place it in the bin or sanitary disposal unit.

[Tampax](https://tampax.com/en-us/you-can-help-proper-disposal) offers similar advice:

> Like many supplies used for personal or medical care, tampons cannot be recycled or flushed. So we have engineered our products to be compatible with existing solid waste disposal systems. They are biodegradable in landfills, but flushing is not ideal for tampon disposal. Tampons cannot be processed by wastewater-treatment facilities and they can harm septic systems.
> 
> Please help us help the environment by disposing of tampons securely in the trash. That way, we can all do our part for the environment.
