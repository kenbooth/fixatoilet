If you're looking for a toilet that packs some power in every flush you need take a look at the [Maximum Performance](http://fixatoilet.boothinteractive.com/blog/2005/03/www.savingwater.org/docs/MapThirdEdition.pdf) (PDF) test results. According to the study, "for sanitary reasons as well as for customer satisfaction, toilets should flush a minimum of approximately 250 grams of solids."

And how was this tested? With fermented bean curd paste having a moisture content of 51.5%, a pH of 4.78 and extruded through a 7/8? diameter die, of course.

The toilet with the greatest flushing power was the Toto Drake (pictured above), knocking down 900 grams of bean curd.
