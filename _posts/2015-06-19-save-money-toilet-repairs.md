The Seattle Times recommends fixing a gravity toilet during a bathroom makeover rather than replacing it. Taking care of toilet repairs on your own can help cut costs during a remodeling job, since new toilets can run from a couple of hundred to several thousand dollars.

> For those times when only a new loo will do, however, consider the bathroom's location. If it's near a kitchen or other living area -- or if your home is small -- you'll probably prefer a quieter toilet, such as a traditional gravity model or a vacuum-assisted toilet. Noisier is a third type: the pressure-assisted model.
