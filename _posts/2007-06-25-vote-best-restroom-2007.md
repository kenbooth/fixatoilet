Cintas is presenting the [America's Best Restroom Award VI](http://www.bestrestrooms.com/index.html). The five finalists are Catch 31, Virginia Beach, VA; Fandangles', Flushing, MI; Jungle Jim's International Market, Fairfield, OH; Mix Lounge at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, NV and Vermont Marble Exhibit, Proctor, VT.

Voting ends July 31 and the winner will be announced in August. Our favorite is the entrance to the Jungle Jim's restroom which is made to look like a porta-potty.
