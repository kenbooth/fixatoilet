_April 2017 Update: The New Plunge seems to be discontinuedÂ and is no longer mentioned on the S&K Manufacturing website._

A plunger replacement hit the market in June. The New Plunge, by [S&K Manufacturing](http://www.skmfg.com/), is a piece of straight, flexible plastic that fits into the toilet drain. According to a press release \[expired link removed\], the New Plunge is easier to clean and store than a traditional plunger.

S&K recommends the following techniques for the New Plunge:

> 1\. Prior to flushing: New Plunge allows you to prevent your toilet from clogging by using the "slice-and-dice" method on waste so that the toilet will not clog. 2. After flushing: Use the New Plunge as you would a plunger.
