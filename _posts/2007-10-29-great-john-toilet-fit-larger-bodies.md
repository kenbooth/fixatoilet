The [Great John Toilet Company](http://www.greatjohn.com/advantages.html) builds an over-sized toilet to provide a more comfortable experience for larger people. The height of this toilet is between 16.5 and 18 inches. The seats are also extra-elongated and extra-wide. The toilet can be installed in new construction and as a replacement for an existing toilet.
